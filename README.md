<b>Summary of Findings:</b>

1.Scatter Plots and Pair Plots:

Scatter plots and pair plots reveal how the sepal and petal measurements (length and width) compare among different iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
The pair plots display relationships and distribution patterns for each pair of features.

2.Pie Chart:

The pie chart shows the proportion of each iris species in the dataset, highlighting the distribution of species.

3.KDE Plots:

KDE plots provide a smooth estimate of the density distribution for petal and sepal measurements.

The KDE plot for Setosa flowers illustrates the density of petal length vs. petal width, showing areas with higher concentrations of data points.


<b>Key Insights:</b>

Species Differences:

Different species of iris flowers exhibit distinct patterns in sepal and petal measurements.
Setosa flowers tend to have smaller petals and sepals compared to Versicolor and Virginica.

Density Distribution:

KDE plots highlight the regions with higher density of petal and sepal measurements.
For Setosa, petal length and width show a clear pattern of density, indicating how these measurements are distributed among the flowers.

Color Coding:

Custom colors in the visualizations (such as purple for KDE plots) help differentiate between various aspects of the data and make the plots more visually informative.

<b>Conclusion:</b>

Distinct Patterns: The visualizations reveal distinct patterns in flower measurements across different iris species. Setosa, in particular, shows a unique density distribution in petal measurements.

Visualization Benefits: Using scatter plots, pair plots, pie charts, and KDE plots provides a comprehensive view of the dataset, helping to understand relationships and distributions.

Data Insights: These visualizations are valuable for identifying how measurements vary by species and for interpreting the overall distribution of iris flower features.
